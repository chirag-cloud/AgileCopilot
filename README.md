# Agile Copilot
Agile CoPilot revolutionizes project management by seamlessly integrating Prompt Engineering with the advanced capabilities of GPT-3.5 Turbo. 
At its core, Agile CoPilot harnesses the power of GPT-3.5 Turbo, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI, to understand and interpret complex queries related to agile methodologies, project management practices, and team collaboration dynamics. Through prompt engineering, we've tailored GPT-3.5 Turbo to efficiently navigate through vast amounts of project data, ensuring precise and contextually relevant responses.

The heart of Agile CoPilot lies in its ability to streamline decision-making processes, enhance productivity, and foster collaboration within agile teams. By hosting the platform on Flask, we provide a user-friendly interface that offers real-time access to invaluable insights derived from the project's historical data.

Key Features:

1. Prompt Engineering: Fine-tuned prompts ensure GPT-3.5 Turbo comprehensively understands agile-related inquiries.
2. Data-Driven Responses: Leveraging project data, Agile CoPilot delivers accurate and personalized responses tailored to the specific needs of the user.
3. Real-Time Assistance: Instantaneous feedback empowers teams to make informed decisions swiftly, optimizing workflow efficiency.
Seamless Integration: Agile CoPilot seamlessly integrates into existing agile project management frameworks, enhancing rather than disrupting established workflows.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Hosted on Flask, the platform offers an intuitive and accessible interface, making it effortless for teams to leverage its capabilities.
